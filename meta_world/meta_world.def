; This is a CommonFx file for ikemen.
; It's meant to handle some system fx and sfx (dizzy, guardbreak) outside of the default fightfx and common.snd to ensure backwards compatibility with preexisting Mugen hitsparks.
; If you're installing or developing your own fightfx, and it already includes custom animations for Ikemen's functions, you can disable this file from config.json.
